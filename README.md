# Supersonic-Nozzle
This is a C code that solves for a supersonic isentropic nozzle. It calculates the normalized values of density, temperature and pressure at the gridpoints inside the nozzle. 
It takes the number of gridpoints and the number of time steps as input and calculates the normalized values of density, temperature and pressure at all the gridpoints.
This code uses the MacCormack's technique to solve a quasi one dimensional nozzle flow solution.
